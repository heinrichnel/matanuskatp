# Implementation Progress Report

## Components Created
- ✅ Created `FleetSelector` component at `/src/components/common/FleetSelector.tsx`
- ✅ Created documentation in `/docs/FLEET_SELECTOR_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
- ✅ Created implementation checklist in `/docs/FLEET_SELECTOR_CHECKLIST.md`
- ✅ Created enhancement summary in `/docs/FLEET_SELECTION_ENHANCEMENT_SUMMARY.md`

## Forms Updated
1. ✅ `InspectionForm.tsx` (Workshop Management) - Replaced with FleetSelector
2. ✅ `TyrePerformanceForm.tsx` (Tyre Management) - Replaced with VehicleSelector
3. ✅ `FaultTracker.tsx` (Workshop Management) - Replaced input with FleetSelector

## Components Already Using Fleet Selection Correctly
- ✅ `VehicleSelector.tsx` - This component already uses the useFleetList hook and provides proper fleet selection

## Components Already Using Fleet Selection Correctly
- ✅ `VehicleSelector.tsx` - This component already uses the useFleetList hook and provides proper fleet selection
- ✅ `TripForm.tsx` (Trip Management) - Already using FleetSelector correctly
- ✅ `ManualDieselEntryModal.tsx` (Diesel Management) - Already using FleetSelector correctly

## Remaining Components to Update
- ✅ `FaultTracker.tsx` (Workshop Management) - Updated with FleetSelector
- ❓ `JobCard.tsx` (Workshop Management) - No fleet selection form found; component uses hardcoded vehicle IDs
- ✅ `FaultTracker.tsx` (Workshop Management) - Updated with FleetSelector
- ❓ `FaultManagement.tsx` (Workshop Management) - No fleet selection fields found in component
- ✅ `DieselDashboard.tsx` (Diesel Management) - Updated fleet filter with FleetSelector

## Summary
We've successfully implemented the FleetSelector component and integrated it across the application. Key findings and accomplishments:

1. Created the FleetSelector component for consistent fleet selection
2. Found that several components (TripForm, ManualDieselEntryModal, VehicleSelector) already use proper fleet selection
3. Updated InspectionForm, TyrePerformanceForm, FaultTracker, and DieselDashboard with proper fleet selection
4. Some components mentioned in the requirements don't have fleet selection fields in the expected locations:
   - JobCard.tsx appears to use hardcoded vehicle IDs without a form for selection
   - FaultManagement.tsx doesn't have fleet selection fields (but FaultTracker.tsx does)

## Implementation Status
| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| FleetSelector.tsx | ✅ | Created central component |
| TripForm.tsx | ✅ | Already using FleetSelector correctly |
| ManualDieselEntryModal.tsx | ✅ | Already using FleetSelector correctly |
| InspectionForm.tsx | ✅ | Updated to use FleetSelector |
| TyrePerformanceForm.tsx | ✅ | Updated to use VehicleSelector |
| FaultTracker.tsx | ✅ | Updated to use FleetSelector |
| DieselDashboard.tsx | ✅ | Updated to use FleetSelector |
| JobCard.tsx | ❓ | No fleet selection form found |
| FaultManagement.tsx | ❓ | No fleet selection fields found |

## Next Steps
1. Confirm with product/development team if JobCard.tsx and FaultManagement.tsx should have fleet selection, and if so, where it should be implemented
2. Continue monitoring for any issues with the implemented FleetSelector components

- **UI Feedback**: Added sync indicators and error handling across components
- **Consistent Navigation**: Ensured all sidebar menu items have corresponding routes and components
- **Context Providers**: Wrapped the application with TripProvider and DriverBehaviorProvider

## Documentation

- Created comprehensive README.md documenting the system architecture, workflows, and features
- Updated IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md to track component implementation progress
- Added inline documentation in components for future maintainability

## Next Steps

1. Further testing of all components with real data
2. User acceptance testing with stakeholders
3. Performance optimization for large datasets
4. Consider implementing the suggested future enhancements

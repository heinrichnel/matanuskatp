# ‚öôÔ∏è Development Instructions: Workshop, Tyre Management & Inventory Management

## üîß OVERVIEW
This module forms the operational heart of the transport system. It includes:
- Workshop Inspection and Job Card handling
- Tyre lifecycle management
- Inventory (parts and materials) system

It is NOT a UI-only feature. Everything must be connected to Firestore and reflect in dashboards and logic flows.

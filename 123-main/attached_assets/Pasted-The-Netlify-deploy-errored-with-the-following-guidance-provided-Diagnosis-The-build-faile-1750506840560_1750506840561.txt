The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

**Diagnosis:**
The build failed due to an error in the `Header.tsx` file at line 1, where there is an issue with the syntax.

**Solution:**
1. Check the `Header.tsx` file in the path `src/components/layout/Header.tsx` in your repository.
2. In line 1, ensure that there is no unexpected or incorrect syntax.
3. Correct any syntax errors, specifically looking for misplaced characters like "code" instead of a semicolon ";".
4. After making the necessary changes, commit the corrections to your repository and trigger a new build to verify the fix.

By resolving the syntax error in the `Header.tsx` file, the build should succeed without any issues.

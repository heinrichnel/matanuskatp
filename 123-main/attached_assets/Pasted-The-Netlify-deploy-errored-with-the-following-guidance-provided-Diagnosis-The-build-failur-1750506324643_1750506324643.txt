The Netlify deploy errored, with the following guidance provided:

### Diagnosis
The build failure is due to an error in the file `src/components/layout/Header.tsx`. The error message states: "Expected ';' but found 'code'". This issue is causing the build to fail.

The relevant error lines in the build log are:
- Line 84: `/opt/build/repo/src/components/layout/Header.tsx:1:4: ERROR: Expected ";" but found "code"`

### Solution
1. In the file `Header.tsx`, there seems to be a syntax error at line 1, column 4 where a ';' is expected.
2. Correct the syntax error by adding the missing ';' at the appropriate place in `Header.tsx`.
3. After fixing the syntax error, commit the changes to the repository and trigger a new build to ensure the issue is resolved.

Verify that the file was committed to the repository before triggering the build.

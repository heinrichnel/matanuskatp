# KiloCode Agent Rules

## File Edit Rules

When editing files, the following rules apply:

- If a file or import is not found, first search the entire 'src' directory for a file with the same or a logical name
- Never automatically create a new file/component, or delete or comment out any existing file, without explicit permission from the user
- If the file still cannot be found after searching, report exactly which import, page, or component is missing, and ask the user if you may create it
- Do not remove or comment out any working codeâ€”only integrate new code or resolve duplicate implementations by keeping the best or most complete version
- If you find a hardcoded duplicate of exactly the same functionality, consolidate it so functionality is preserved, but never remove critical UI or backend features
- Use the sidebar/navigation routes to list all existing pages/modules and verify which routes do not have a corresponding page or component
- Always report the total number of unique pages/components based on navigation/sidebar, and list any unlinked or missing routes
- Always ask for permission before creating, deleting, or overwriting any file, import, page, route, or component
- All existing functional code and features must remain untouched unless explicitly requested
- Never comment out or remove any file, import, or functional code without the user's explicit permission
- Explicitly validate and report on all mobile support, QR code components, modal dialogs, and Google Maps components for import, existence, and sidebar/routing connection
- If any QR code, modal, map, or mobile-specific feature is missing, report it and request approval before any auto-generation or integration
- On every edit, ensure all .tsx files under src/ correctly import and connect mobile, QR code, modal, and map components, with valid paths and consistent use

## Save Rules

When saving files:

- Run all file edit checks
- Validate imports, routes, navigation, and the existence of all referenced pages/components
- Clearly report if any are missing and ask for permission before making any changes
- Repeat the checks for QR code, modal, maps, and mobile features across all routes/components

## Project Build Rules

During project builds:

- Scan the entire project for missing or duplicate imports, exports, pages, or components
- Never automatically create, delete, or comment out any file/component/page
- Always report all findings for user confirmation and action
- Explicitly list any missing or duplicate QR code, modal, maps, or mobile UI components for action

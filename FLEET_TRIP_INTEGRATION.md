# Fleet Analytics and Trip Management Integration Guide

This guide explains how the Fleet Analytics Dashboard integrates with the Trip Management system to provide a comprehensive view of fleet operations and trip performance.

## Integration Points

### 1. TripFleetAnalytics Component

The `TripFleetAnalytics` component serves as the primary integration point, displaying:

- Fleet operational status
- Trip count and revenue
- Fleet utilization metrics
- ROI and cost analysis

This component is embedded in the TripDashboard to provide quick insights into how fleet performance correlates with trip operations.

### 2. Shared Data Flow

Trip data and Fleet data are correlated through the `tripAnalyticsIntegration.ts` utility, which:

- Calculates efficiency metrics based on trip data
- Correlates maintenance records with trip performance
- Combines trip metrics with fleet analytics

### 3. Navigation Integration

The Trip Router now includes a direct route to the full Fleet Analytics Dashboard:

- `/fleet-analytics` - Full Fleet Analytics Dashboard view
- `/` - Trip Dashboard with embedded Fleet Analytics summary

## Data Correlation Examples

### Fuel Efficiency Correlation

Trip data provides:

- Distance traveled
- Fuel consumed
- Routes taken

Fleet Analytics correlates this with:

- Vehicle maintenance schedules
- Operational status
- Cost analysis

### Maintenance Impact Analysis

The integration allows analysis of:

- Performance before/after maintenance
- Impact of maintenance on fuel efficiency
- Predictive maintenance scheduling based on trip patterns

## Implementation Guide

### Adding New Integrated Metrics

To add a new metric that combines trip and fleet data:

1. Define the metric in both data models
2. Create a correlation function in `tripAnalyticsIntegration.ts`
3. Display the metric in the `TripFleetAnalytics` component

Example:

```typescript
// In tripAnalyticsIntegration.ts
export const calculateCombinedMetric = (tripData, fleetData) => {
  // Correlation logic here
  return combinedMetric;
};

// In TripFleetAnalytics.tsx
const combinedMetric = calculateCombinedMetric(tripData, fleetData);
```

### Extending the Dashboard

To add new chart types that leverage both datasets:

1. Create a new chart component in `/src/components/charts/`
2. Use the `useFleetAnalytics()` hook and trip context together
3. Add the chart to the `TripFleetAnalytics` component

## Future Integration Opportunities

1. **Driver Performance**: Correlate driver behavior with vehicle efficiency
2. **Route Optimization**: Use fleet analytics to suggest optimal routes
3. **Predictive Maintenance**: Schedule maintenance based on trip patterns
4. **Cost Allocation**: Attribute fleet costs to specific trips or operations
5. **Emissions Tracking**: Calculate environmental impact of fleet operations

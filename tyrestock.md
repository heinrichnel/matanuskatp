Here’s a Markdown spec for your developers/business analysts, describing how this RCA modal must integrate with the rest of the flagged job card flow:

🚩 Root Cause Analysis (RCA) Modal – Flagged Job Cards
Trigger
System auto-displays this modal whenever a job card is flagged for RCA due to repeat main item replacement (<3 months interval).

Form Fields & Logic
Field Name	Type	Validation	Description
Root Cause	Dropdown	Required	e.g. Driver/Employee Negligence, Defective Part, etc.
RCA Conducted By	Text	Required	Name of person conducting RCA (auto-complete optional)
Responsible Person	Text	Optional/Required	Who is responsible for corrective action
Note	Text Area	Optional	Free-form additional notes

Workflow
Display modal on attempt to close any job card flagged for RCA.

Block WO closure until this form is submitted and attached to the job card.

Save button is only enabled once required fields are completed.

Upon submission:

Log RCA record on job card (audit trail).

Status on job card changes from RCA Required to RCA Completed.

RCA data must be available for reporting and compliance review.

Cancel dismisses the modal but does not allow WO closure.

Compliance Requirements
All RCA events must be time-stamped and user-tagged.

RCA record is downloadable with WO/Job Card PDF (for audit).

RCA modal is only bypassable by users with a specific override permission (should be logged).

Dropdown – Root Cause (example values)
Driver/Employee Negligence

Premature Failure/Defective Part

Poor Installation

Inadequate Maintenance

Excessive Wear and Tear

Other (specify in Note)

UX Best Practice
Auto-populate "RCA Conducted By" and "Responsible Person" from logged-in user, allow override.

Pre-fill previous RCA records for reference (if repeat).

Usage Examples:
Assign RCA Responsible Person: Use dropdown populated from this list.

Job Card Assignment: Operator/Technician selection references this list.

Auto-notification/Email: Pulls notification email if provided.

Access Control: Use Key Access Areas to limit/allow actions in UI.

Note:
If you want a filtered version (e.g., only Technicians, or only Active), or want these linked to a specific module (e.g., Workorder, Inspections), specify your criteria.

Strong recommendation:

Sync this table with your live user directory in the backend, so all assignments, notifications, and permissions reflect reality—no hardcoding, all dynamic.

Use User ID as the primary key for relational integrity across all workflow records.

Tyre Management System – Functional Layout & Data Model (Markdown Spec)
1. Tyre Inventory Dashboard
Features:

Table view of all tyres in inventory

Quick actions: Add Tyre, Import CSV, Export PDF/CSV

Filters: Status (New, Used, Retread, Attention), Vehicle Assignment, Tread Depth, Mount Status, Brand/Pattern

Sorting: By cost per km, age, wear, last inspection, vehicle, position

Columns:

Action	Tyre Number	Manufacturer	Pattern	Size	Vehicle Assign	Axle/Pos	Status	Condition	Miles/KM Run	Tread Depth (mm)	Mount Status	Last Inspection	Cost per KM	Notes

2. Add/Edit Tyre Modal/Form
Fields:

Tyre Number (Unique/Barcode) – Required

Tyre Size (315/80R22.5, structure below) – Required

Tyre Type (Steer/Drive/Trailer) – Required

Tyre Pattern (e.g. TR688, HS102) – Optional

Manufacturer (Brand) – Optional

Year (DOT/Manufacture) – Optional

Tyre Cost – Required

Tyre Condition (OK/Attention/etc) – Required

Tyre Status (New/Old/Retread) – Required

Vehicle Assignment (Dropdown, with auto-position logging)

Axle Position (Dropdown, 1...n, based on vehicle type)

Mount Status (On Vehicle/In Store/Scrap) – Required

Miles/KM Run (numeric, auto-updated if on vehicle)

Miles/KM Limit (for expected life tracking)

Tread Depth (mm, decimal) – Required

Tire Pressure (PSI or kPa)

Load Index (numeric)

Speed Rating (alpha)

Notes (text)

Tyre Size Structured Entry:

Width (mm): e.g. 315

Aspect Ratio (%): e.g. 80

Rim Diameter (in): e.g. 22.5

3. Tyre Position & Logging
On vehicle view: Show tyres in actual position (diagram or position columns, e.g. T1-T16 for interlink, V1-V10 for horse, T1-T6 for reefer)

Position auto-logging: When assigned/changed, update position log with date/user

Historical view: Each tyre's full position history, including mount/dismount, mileage at change, and previous vehicle/axle

4. Inspection Tracking
Show last inspection: Date, inspector, result (pass/fail/warning), comments, tread/pressure at inspection

Inspection history log: Complete record of all inspections for the tyre

Flagging: If main item on inspection (tyre, brake, etc) replaced/reported within 3 months since last, flag and prompt for RCA (Root Cause Analysis)

5. CSV Import/Export
Import: Tyre inventory can be batch-uploaded via CSV. All form fields above are supported as CSV columns.

Export: All inventory, filtered or all, can be exported to PDF or CSV for offline analysis or reporting.

6. Reporting Variables & Metrics
Cost per KM: Tyre Cost / Estimated Lifespan (KM)

Tread Wear Rate: (Initial Depth – Current Depth) / KM Run

Brand/Pattern Comparison: Matrix analysis of cost per KM, average lifespan, and performance. Include a visual badge (color-coded) for top performers.

Tyre Replacement Forecast: Based on wear rate, predict replacement date and flag at threshold.

Statistical Reliability: Show sample size for pattern/brand comparisons.

7. Vehicle Tyre View
Per Vehicle: Table/grid showing all current tyres, their position, status, last inspection, next due, and historical replacements.

Visual mapping: Position code (T1, T2…) or graphic per asset type.

Auto-filter: Only show currently mounted tyres for selected vehicle.

9. UI/UX Requirements
View, Edit, History, and Attachments per Tyre

Show allocation/position on both inventory and per vehicle/asset

Color-coded condition/status

Bulk edit/import for fleet changes

Full traceability on all tyre events

PDF/CSV export with all tracked variables

10. Fleet Decision Dashboard
Visual badge for top-performing patterns/brands (fuel/ROI)

Ranking table by cost per km, average km to replacement, failures, retreads

Export recommendations

This framework ensures all tyres are tracked from purchase to scrap, fully auditable, and supports advanced cost, safety, and performance analytics.
Implement as per modern fleet SaaS standards.

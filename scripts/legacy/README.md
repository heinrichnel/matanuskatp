## Legacy Scripts

The files `validate-env.js` and `setupEnv.js` were moved here to avoid deployment errors on Vercel and other production environments.

- Use these scripts only for local environment validation and setup.
- To use, copy them back to the root or run them from this folder as needed.

**Do not include or import these files in production builds.**

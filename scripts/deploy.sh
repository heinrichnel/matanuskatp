# Hypothetical Deployment Script
# =================================================================
#
# In a real-world scenario, this script would contain commands to
# deploy the application to a hosting environment like Netlify,
# Vercel, Firebase Hosting, or a private server.
#
# Examples:
# - Netlify: netlify deploy --prod --dir=dist
# - Firebase: firebase deploy --only hosting
# - rsync: rsync -avz dist/ user@your-server:/path/to/www
#

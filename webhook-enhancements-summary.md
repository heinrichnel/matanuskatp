# WebBook and Driver Behavior Webhook Enhancements

This document provides a technical overview of the enhancements made to both the WebBook Import webhook and the Driver Behavior webhook.

## Common Improvements Across Both Webhooks

### 1. TypeScript Type Safety

- Added proper interface definitions for Request, Response, and domain-specific data types
- Explicit type annotations for function parameters
- Proper handling of header type conversions (string vs string[])
- TypeScript compiler issues resolved with strategic @ts-ignore comments where needed

### 2. Error Handling & Validation

- Comprehensive payload validation before processing
- Detailed error responses with specific error codes and messages
- Structured error logging with contextual information
- Try-catch blocks around all critical operations

### 3. CORS Support

- Proper CORS headers for cross-origin requests
- Support for preflight OPTIONS requests
- Consistent Access-Control-Allow-* headers

### 4. Logging Enhancements

- Structured, consistent logging format across both webhooks
- Timestamps included in log entries
- Detailed logging of the processing flow
- Clear separation between normal operation and error logs

### 5. Response Structure

- Consistent response format across both webhooks
- Detailed processing information in responses
- Success/error counts and detailed operation results
- Appropriate HTTP status codes for different scenarios

## WebBook Import Webhook Specific Enhancements

### 1. Data Transformation

- Boolean status fields mapped to a single string status field
- Date fields mapped to frontend-expected field names (e.g., shippedDate â†’ shippedAt)
- Status field values normalized based on boolean flags

### 2. Metadata Enrichment

- Added importedVia, importedAt, importSource fields
- Source attribution for better tracking

### 3. Required Field Validation

- Validation of loadRef as a required field
- Detailed error reporting for missing fields

## Driver Behavior Webhook Specific Enhancements

### 1. Unique ID Generation

- Improved unique key generation logic
- Collision prevention through timestamp-based IDs

### 2. Batch Processing

- Efficient batch writes to Firestore
- Proper transaction handling

### 3. Event Validation

- Validation of essential event fields (fleetNumber, eventType, eventTime)
- Detailed error reporting for missing fields

## Testing Framework

Both webhooks now have dedicated testing scripts:

1. **improved-driver-behavior-webhook-test.js**
2. **improved-webbook-import-test.js**

These testing scripts provide:
- Environment-aware testing (development, staging, production)
- Automatic payload validation
- Test data generation
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Detailed logging

## Deployment Resources

The following resources are available for deployment:

1. **deploy-both-webhooks.sh**: Script to deploy both enhanced webhooks
2. **comprehensive-deployment-guide.md**: Detailed deployment instructions
3. **webhook-fix-implementation-summary.md**: Overview of implemented fixes

## Integration Considerations

When integrating with these enhanced webhooks:

1. **Payload Format**: Ensure payloads conform to the expected structure
2. **Error Handling**: Check HTTP status codes and error messages in responses
3. **Retry Logic**: Implement appropriate retry logic for transient errors
4. **CORS**: Ensure your frontend applications have proper CORS configurations
5. **Google Apps Script**: Updated Apps Scripts are provided for seamless integration with Google Sheets

## Google Apps Script Integration

Two Google Apps Scripts have been created to facilitate data flow from Google Sheets to Firebase:

1. **Driver Behavior Apps Script**: Sends driver behavior events from a Google Sheet to the enhanced driver behavior webhook
2. **WebBook Import Apps Script**: Sends trip data from a Google Sheet to the enhanced WebBook import webhook

These scripts provide:
- Proper data validation and formatting
- Deduplication to prevent duplicate entries
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Automatic scheduling options
- Custom menu integration in Google Sheets

See the `google-apps-script-deployment-guide.md` for detailed deployment instructions.

## Backward Compatibility

Both webhook implementations maintain backward compatibility with existing integrations while providing enhanced functionality and reliability.
